### Project Description

<li>The aim is to make a String Processor which allows a customizable pipeline.

<li>The String Processorâ€™s main focus is speed efficiency and customizability. For that purpose each string
will pass through 3 stages, each stage having a customizable number operations chosen from a subset.
You will have to implement an application which receives the path to a file containing strings, 1 on each
line. 
<li>The application will read all the strings in the file and then pass them to the String Processor which
will run the strings through the 3 stages, and when finished write the output to a file.
